# Job Listing and Bookmarking Application

This is a simple React-based job listing application that allows users to:

- Fetch and display jobs from an external API.
- Bookmark jobs for later viewing.
- View bookmarked jobs in a separate component.
- Remove bookmarked jobs from both the state and local storage.

## Features

- **Job Listing**: Fetches job data from an external API and displays it in a user-friendly layout.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Allows users to scroll through the job listings without needing to navigate through pages.
- **Bookmarking Jobs**: Users can bookmark jobs and view them later in the "Bookmarks" section.
- **Local Storage**: Bookmark data is stored in local storage, allowing the user to access it even after page refreshes.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring usability across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Delete Bookmarks**: Users can delete jobs from their bookmarks, and the local storage will be updated accordingly.
